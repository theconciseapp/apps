</h2>
      <p class="lead">
      	A School key is a unique identifier (simply a username) that you create when you register your school on our platform. For example, if the name of your school is "Amazing Grace International School of Excellence", you can create a nice school key like "Amazing" or "AGISE". This School key will be used by your school teachers along with their staff keys(generated when you add staffs) to login on <strong>True School</strong> app.

  <h2 style="font-size:1.4rem;margin-top:0;">Why use a School Key?</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:18px">
    While individual teachers can use <strong>True School</strong> app without a school key, but with a School Key, the experience becomes center-based and connected, unlocks full school-wide administration and reporting features.
  </p>
  
<div style="display:grid; gap:16px">
    <div  class="card">
  <strong>Unified administration</strong>
 <br>
   With a school key, all teachers share the same or uniform configurations such as School name, address, school term/session, resumption & closing time, logo, stamp e.t.c set by the school admin from the <a href="https://oshobby.com.ng/ts/dashboard">dashboard</a>. The school admin sets up the school once on the dashboard, add Staffs (Class teachers), create classes and assign classes to each staff.
  </div>
  
    <div style="padding:14px;border-radius:8px" class="card">
      <strong>Centralized reporting</strong><br>
      Teachers submit daily attendance directly to the dashboard from the app, allowing the school admin to view, manage, and print student's attendance reports & results with ease.
    </div>
    
    <div style="padding:14px;border-radius:8px" class="card">
      <strong>Parent access</strong><br>
      Parents can view their child’s attendance daily, ensuring peace of mind that their children are present in school each day. They can also check their child's results at the comfort of their homes or offices: <a href="https://oshobby.com.ng/ts/results">https://oshobby.com.ng/ts/results</a>
    </div>
    
      <div style="padding:14px;border-radius:8px" class="card">
      <strong>Generate Income</strong><br>
